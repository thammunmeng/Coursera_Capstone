    "The aim for this final project is to explores the best locations for chinese restaurants throughout the city of New York. New York is a major metropolitan area with more than 8.4 million (Quick Facts, 2018) people living within city limits. Being the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia, the need to find and enjoy chinese cuisine is on the rise. This report explores which neighborhoods and boroughs of New York City have the most as well as the best chinese restaurants. Additionally, I will attempt to answer the questions “Where should I open an chinese restaurant?” and “Where should I stay If I want great chinese food?”\n"
